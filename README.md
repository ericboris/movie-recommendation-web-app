The Movie Recommendation Web App is a user-friendly, single-page application digned to help users discover new movies based on their own ratings and the ratings of others. This personal project focuses on providing a smooth user experience and ensures security by utilizing MetaMask integration for authentication and authorization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                      
Upon visiting the app, users can connect or disconnect their MetaMask wallet for authentication. The app features a search bar for users to find movies by title or genre, and a movie list displaying tailored recommendations. If users haven't connected a MetaMask wallet or rated any movies, the list displays general recommendations based on other users' ratings. Clearing the search bar repopulates the list with recommendations from the system.
                                                                                                      
Movie cards in the list display the title, poster, release year, and a 5-star rating system. Users connected to MetaMask can rate movies, while unconnected users are prompted to connect when attempting to rate. Clicking on a movie card reveals additional details, such as description, director, and actors.
                                                                                                      
The app emphasizes a seamless experience by implementing input validation, error handling, and logging to prevent and address errors or exceptions. Thorough testing will be conducted to resolve any bugs or issues, delivering a reliable experience for all users.
