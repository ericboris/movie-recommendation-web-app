The application will be deployed using Kubernetes, using Helm as the package manager for the application. A load balancer will be used to distribute traffic to the app's replicas. Auto-scaling will be configured based on CPU and memory usage. Logs and metrics will be collected and analyzed using tools like Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK stack). The database will be deployed using Amazon RDS, with regular backups and disaster recovery strategies.
